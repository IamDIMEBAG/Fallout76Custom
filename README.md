Here is my Fallout76Custom.ini. I will update this as I make any changes to the file.

Simply clone the repository to your PC via git (Command Prompt) or GitHub Dekstop. Alternatively download the raw file from the github page. (https://github.com/IamDIMEBAG/Fallout76Custom/blob/main/Fallout76Custom.ini)
Just click the download button in the top right

You can also make a symbolic link to your Fallout 76 folder using the following command in Command Prompt (May need to run cmd as admin)

```mklink "C:\Users\YOUR WINDOWS USERNAME\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76\Fallout76Custom.ini" "YOUR PATH TO CLONED REPOSITORY\Fallout76Custom.ini"```
